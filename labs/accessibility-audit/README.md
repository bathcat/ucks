# Lab: Accessibility Audit

## Summary 

You're the new [UX Unicorn](https://uxplanet.org/what-is-a-ux-unicorn-do-ux-unicorns-exist-and-should-you-become-one-73a7e2bcc9b4) 
on a team with several existing applications. To get up to speed, you will be auditing the accessibility of an existing application 
by borrowing from the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).


## Requirements
The goal is to evaluate one small part of an application and suggest changes.

1. Choose something to audit. It can be an application you're familiar with, or something new. 
   
   Here are some examples you might use:
     * Search for accomidations on [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
	 * Add a vehicle to your garage on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/your-garage)
	 * Edit this document using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)

2. Use the tools. 
  * Lighthouse accessibility reports are built into modern browsers.
  * Disability simulators can give you a subjective idea of the experience for specific impairments.

3. Manually evaluate:
  * Keyboard navigation
  * Affordances
