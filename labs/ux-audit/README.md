# Lab: UX Audit

## Summary 

You're the new [UX Unicorn](https://uxplanet.org/what-is-a-ux-unicorn-do-ux-unicorns-exist-and-should-you-become-one-73a7e2bcc9b4) 
on a team with several existing applications. To get up to speed, you will be auditing the user experience
of a particular interaction by borrowing from the [UX Honeycomb](https://danewesolko.medium.com/peter-morvilles-user-experience-honeycomb-904c383b6886).


## Requirements
1. Choose something to audit. It can be an application you're familiar with, or something new. 
   
   Here are some examples you might use:
     * Search for accomidations on [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
	 * Add a vehicle to your garage on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/your-garage)
	 * Edit this document using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
   
   
2. Evaluate a specific piece of functionality. Begin using the UX Honeycomb, and add anything else that makes
   sense. You don't have to write too much. Just think through each facet and be ready to discuss each one.
