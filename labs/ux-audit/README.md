# Lab: UX Audit

## Summary 

You're the new [UX Unicorn](https://uxplanet.org/what-is-a-ux-unicorn-do-ux-unicorns-exist-and-should-you-become-one-73a7e2bcc9b4) 
on a team with several existing applications. To get up to speed, you will be auditing the user experience
of a particular interaction by borrowing from the [UX Honeycomb](https://danewesolko.medium.com/peter-morvilles-user-experience-honeycomb-904c383b6886).


## Requirements
1. Choose something to audit. It can be an application you're familiar with, or something new. 
   
   Here are some examples you might use:
     * Search for accomidations on [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
	 * Add a vehicle to your garage on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/your-garage)
	 * Edit this document using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
   
   
2. Evaluate a specific piece of functionality. Begin using the UX Honeycomb, and add anything else that makes
   sense. You don't have to write too much. Just think through each facet and be ready to discuss each one.


## Example

For example, [Superbetize](http://superbetize.com/) is an application for categorizing your 
grocery list. The idea is make your trip to the store more efficient. Here's what an evaluation
might look like--

### Evaluation

| Dimension      | Rating | Notes                                                    |
| :------------- | :----: | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| __Findable__   | 5      | Right there on the home page.                            |
| __Useful__     | 4      | Wasn't able to categorize everything.                    |
| __Usable__     | 5      | Easy to enter items, but no way to upload a spreadsheet. |
| __Desirable__  | 5      | No complaints                                            |
| __Accessible__ | 4      | Low contrast; hard to read in bright light.              | 
| __Credible__   | 5      | No complaints.                                           |

### Comments

Good app. The button text could be more clear-- 'Superbetize' isn't a word in English, and the 
app itself isn't famous enough to have entered the lexicon. Something like 'Categorize' might be better.
