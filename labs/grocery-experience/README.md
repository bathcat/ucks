# Lab: Grocery Experience

## Summary: 

You are helping to design the user experience of a new grocery store under construction 
in the quaint mountain town of [Nederland, CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederland,_Colorado). The first
step is to determine which products go on which aisles. For this exercise, you will create personas
representing typical shoppers. Next recruit representative testers from your (probably limited) pool and 
have them sort cards representing various products into groups representing their physical placement in the store.


## Requirements
1. **Create some first-draft user personas.** In real life, these would be informed through conversations with 
marketing and the product team. For this exercise, take a guess based on the people that shop at your grocery 
store.

2. **Sort cards** Recruit some users from your pool to reflect how your personas think of common grocery items.
   * Use a copy of the miro board [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPP7P-PM=/?share_link_id=259864258236)
   * OR use some other tool-- like a text editor-- to categorize the products in `starting-point/cards.md`
